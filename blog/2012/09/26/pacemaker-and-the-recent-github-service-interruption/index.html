                <p>It never fails. Someone manages to break their Pacemaker cluster, and
<a href="http://openlife.cc/author">Henrik</a> starts preaching <a href="http://openlife.cc/blogs/2012/september/failover-evil">his usual sermon
of why Pacemaker is
terrible</a> and why
you should never-ever use it. And when that someone is
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, which we all know, use and love, then
that sermon gets a bit of excess attention. Let's take a quick look at
the facts.</p>
<!--break-->
<!--break-->
<p>The week of September 10, GitHub suffered a couple of outages which
caused a total downtime of 1 hour and 46 minutes, as
<a href="https://github.com/jnewland">Jesse</a> precisely pointed out <a href="https://github.com/blog/1261-github-availability-this-week">in a blog
post</a>.
Exhibiting the excellent transparency that GitHub always offers at any
time its infrastructure is affected by issues (remember <a href="https://github.com/blog/1068-public-key-security-vulnerability-and-mitigation">their
role-model behavior in an SSH security
incident</a>
a few months back), Jesse explains, in a very detailed way, what
happened on one of their Pacemaker clusters.</p>
<p>Now, all of what follows is based exclusively on the information in that
blog post of Jesse's. I have no inside knowledge of the incident, so my
picture may be incomplete or skewed. But here's my take on it anyway. I
do encourage you to read Jesse's post full-length, as the rest of this
post otherwise won't make much sense. I'll just quote certain pieces of
it and comment on them here.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note:</strong> nothing in this post should be construed as a put-down
of GitHub's excellent staff. They run a fantastic service and do an
awesome job. It's just that their post-mortem seems to have created some
misconceptions in the MySQL community about the Pacemaker stack as a
whole, and those I'd like to help rectify. Also, I'm posting this in the
hope that it provides useful insight to both the GitHub folks, and to
anyone else facing similar issues.</em></p>
<h2>Enable Maintenance Mode when you should</h2>
<p>From the original post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monday's migration caused higher load on the database than our
operations team has previously seen during these sorts of migrations.
So high, in fact, that they caused Percona Replication Manager's
health checks to fail on the master. In response to the failed master
health check, Percona Replication manager moved the 'active' role and
the master database to another server in the cluster and stopped MySQL
on the node it perceived as failed.</p>
<p></p>
At the time of this failover, the new database selected for the
'active' role had a cold InnoDB buffer pool and performed rather
poorly. The system load generated by the site's query load on a cold
cache soon caused Percona Replication Manager's health checks to fail
again, and the 'active' role failed back to the server it was on
originally.</blockquote>
<p></p>
At this point, I decided to disable all health checks by enabling
Pacemaker's <code>maintenance-mode</code>; an operating mode in which no health
checks or automatic failover actions are performed. Performance on the
site slowly recovered as the buffer pool slowly reached normal levels.
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>Now there's actually several issues in there even in this early stage.
Maintenance mode is generally the right thing to do here, but you enable
it <em>before</em> making large changes to the configuration, and you disable
it when done. If you're uncomfortable with the cluster manager taking
its hands off the entire cluster, and you know what you're doing, you
could also just disable cluster management and monitoring on a specific
resource. Both approaches are explained
<a href="https://www.hastexo.com/resources/hints-and-kinks/maintenance-active-pacemaker-clusters">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, as far as "health checks failing" on the master is concerned,
pretty much the only thing that is likely to cause such a failure in
this instance is a timeout, and you can adjust those even on a
per-operation basis in Pacemaker. But even that is unnecessary if you
enable maintenance mode at the right time.</p>
<h2>"Maintenance mode" really means maintenance mode</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The following morning, our operations team was notified by a developer
of incorrect query results returning from the node providing the
'standby' role. I investigated the situation and determined that when
the cluster was placed into maintenance-mode the day before, actions
that should have caused the node elected to serve the 'standby' role
to change its replication master and start replicating were prevented
from occurring.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, of course. In maintenance mode, Pacemaker takes its hands off your
resources. If you're enabling maintenance mode right in the middle of a
failover, then that's not exactly a stellar idea. If you do, then it's
your job to complete those actions manually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I determined that the best course of action was to
disable <code>maintenance-mode</code> to allow Pacemaker and the Percona
Replication Manager to rectify the situation.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Best" might be an exaggeration, if I may say so.</p>
<h2>A segfault and rejected cluster messages</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon attempting to disable <code>maintenance-mode</code>, a Pacemaker segfault
occurred that resulted in a cluster state partition.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, that's bad, but what exactly segfaulted? crmd? attrd? pengine? Or
the master Heartbeat process? But the next piece of information would
have me believe that the segfault really isn't the root cause of the
cluster partition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After this update, two nodes (I'll call them 'a' and 'b') rejected
most messages from the third node ('c'), while the third node rejected
most messages from the other two.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it's a pity that we don't have any version information and logs, but
this looks very much like the "not in our membership" issue present up
to Pacemaker 1.1.6. This is a known issue, the fix is to update to a
more recent version (<a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/commit/03f6105592281901cc10550b8ad19af4beb5f72f">here's the
commit,</a> on
GitHub of course), and the workaround is to just restart the Pacemaker
services on the affected node(s) while in maintenance mode.</p>
<h2>A non-quorate partition running MySQL?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite having configured the cluster to require a majority of
machines to agree on the state of the cluster before taking action,
two simultaneous master election decisions were attempted without
proper coordination. In the first cluster, master election was
interrupted by messages from the second cluster and MySQL was stopped.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is an example of me being tempted to say, "logs or it didn't
happen." If you've got the default no-quorum-policy of "block", and
you're getting a non-quorate partition, and you don't have any resources
with operations <em>explicitly</em> configured to ignore quorum, then "two
simultaneous master election decisions" can only refer to the Designated
Coordinator (DC) election, which has no bearing whatsoever on MySQL
master status. Luckily, Pacemaker allows us to take a meaningful
snapshot of all cluster logs and status after the fact with crm_report.
It would be quite interesting to see a tarball from that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the second, single-node cluster, node 'c' was elected at 8:19 AM,
and any subsequent messages from the other two-node cluster were
discarded. As luck would have it, the 'c' node was the node that our
operations team previously determined to be out of date. We detected
this fact and powered off this out-of-date node at 8:26 AM to end the
partition and prevent further data drift, taking down all production
database access and thus all access to github.com.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's obviously a bummer, but really, if that partition is non-quorate,
and Pacemaker hasn't explicitly been configured to ignore that, no
cluster resources would start there. Needless to say a working fencing
configuration would have helped oodles, too.</p>
<h2>Your cluster has no crystal ball, but it does have a command line</h2>
<p>I'll skip over most of the rest of the GitHub post, because it's an
explanation of how these backend issues affected GitHub users. I'll just
hop on down to this piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The automated failover of our main production database could be
described as the root cause of both of these downtime events. In each
situation in which that occurred, if any member of our operations team
had been asked if the failover should have been performed, the answer
would have been a resounding no.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, you could have told your Pacemaker of that fact beforehand. Enable
maintenance mode and you're good to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many situations in which automated failover is an excellent
strategy for ensuring the availability of a service. After careful
consideration, we've determined that ensuring the availability of our
primary production database is not one of these situations. To this
end, we've made changes to our Pacemaker configuration to ensure
failover of the 'active' database role will only occur when initiated
by a member of our operations team.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That splash you just heard was the bath water. The scream was the baby
being tossed out with it.</p>
<p>Automated failover is a pretty poor strategy <em>in the middle of a large
configuration change.</em> And Pacemaker gives you a simple and easy
interface to disable it, by changing a single cluster property. Failure
to do so may result in problems, and in this case it did.</p>
<p>When you put a baby seat on the passenger side of your car, you disable
the air bag to prevent major injury. But if you take that baby seat out
and an adult passenger rides with you, are you seriously saying you're
going to manually initiate the air bag in case of a crash? I hope you're
not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, our operations team is performing a full audit of our
Pacemaker and Heartbeat stack focusing on the code path that triggered
the segfault on Tuesday.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's probably a really good idea. For anyone planning to do the same,
