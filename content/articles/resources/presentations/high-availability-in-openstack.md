An update on high-availability development during the
[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org) Folsom development cycle. This
presentation was delivered August 30, 2012 in San Diego, California. It
was part of the inaugural
[CloudOpen](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudopen-north-america)
conference hosted by the [Linux
Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org).

Following up on my earlier talks at OpenStack Summit and OSCON, I
summarized the high-availability features OpenStack gained during the
Folsom development cycle.
