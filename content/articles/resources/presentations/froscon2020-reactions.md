### Twitter, 2021-04-10

On Twitter, [Michael K Johnson](https://musings.danlj.org/about/) made
[an interesting
point](https://twitter.com/mcdanlj/status/1380661700664422406) in
response to this article:

>  My way of thinking about DMs is a little different, or maybe we

I entirely agree with the sentiments behind this; I still maintain
that chat DMs are not necessarily a good approach for addressing this,
for reason that some chat systems give merely an illusion of
confidentiality. If both participants in a conversation use OTR
encryption over a protocol like IRC or XMPP, inadvertent disclosure to
a third party is highly unlikely. Slack DMs? [I wouldn't be so
sure](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/business/slack-updates-privacy-policy-employers-can-read-private-dms-without-ncna862811). If
your report confides in you, you don't want them to have to worry if
their message is *really* just between you and them.


### Hacker News, 2021-09-25

On 2021-09-25, [a link to this
article](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28636536) ended up being
the top post on Hacker News for a few hours. You're very welcome to
read through the 200-odd comments in that thread, but here I'd like to
respond to just a couple. I'm deliberately only picking out ones where I
feel like *clarification* on my part is necessary; as far as
differences of opinion are concerned I'll be happy to let those stand.

My native language is German, and neither at the time of presenting
the original talk nor at the time of writing this update did I work
with anyone who is a first-language English speaker.

My blanket disregard is for *naked* pings, not for pings in general.
