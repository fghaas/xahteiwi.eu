[Open edX](http://open.edx.org) is an extensible, highly scalable,
open-source learning management platform. Originally conceived at
[MIT](http://www.mit.edu) and [Harvard
University](http://www.harvard.edu), the edx.org platform it is
currently backed by more than 70 organizations world-wide and serves
more than 4 million students. Since 2013, the software running edx.org
is available under an open source software license, enabling private and
public organizations to run and operate the same learning platform under
the Open edX initiative.

hastexo's contribution to Open edX is twofold: first, we enabled Open
edX to run in an automated, distributed fashion on the OpenStack
platform. Then, we taught Open edX the ability to automate the
orchestration of on-demand OpenStack training environments. Both are now
an integral part of our hastexo Academy service offering.

advantage? Check out the short animation below (with audio) to find out.
