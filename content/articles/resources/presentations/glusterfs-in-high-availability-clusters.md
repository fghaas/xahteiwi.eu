My Pacemaker presentation from the GlusterFS Workshop at LinuxCon
Europe 2012. Presented in Barcelona in November of 2012, this is a
overview of integrating GlusterFS with the Pacemaker cluster stack.

This tutorial gives an overview of

-   The Pacemaker stack,
-   Using GlusterFS for Pacemaker storage,
-   Managing GlusterFS volumes from Pacemaker.

My original presentation included several live demos. In this version,
they have been replaced by placeholders.
