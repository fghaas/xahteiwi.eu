My Ceph tutorial from LinuxCon Europe 2012. Presented in
Barcelona in November of 2012, this is a dense summary of the features
of the [Ceph](https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/storage-io/ceph)
distributed storage stack.

This tutorial gives an overview of

-   Native RADOS object storage,
-   The RBD block device,
-   ReSTful object storage with radosgw,
-   the Ceph distributed filesystem.

My original presentation included several live demos. In this
version, they have been replaced by placeholders.
