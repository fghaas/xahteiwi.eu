I team up with Tim Serong and Andrew Beekhof for a tutorial at
linux.conf.au 2012.

<!--break-->

Pacemaker author Andrew Beekhof dropped in as well, to field questions
and provide additional insight into Pacemaker development.

The tutorial covers the configuration of a MySQL 2-node high
availability cluster front to back, diving into the configuration of
replicated storage,Â the cluster communications infrastructure, cluster
resource management, and of course the MySQL database itself.

Reviews for this tutorial were rather enthusiastic, with bloggers
comparing the experience to [an enlightenment session from the Jedi
grand
masters](http://www.anchor.com.au/blog/2012/01/lca-day-3-high-availability/)
of high availability.
