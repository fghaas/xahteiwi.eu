Summary: My talk from PyConline AU 2020.

Iâ€™ve been wanting to speak at PyCon.au for a long time now, and
finally did for the 2020 *PyConline AU* edition.

This was a truly wonderful conference, in which the organisers and
attendees collectively bent over backwards and put in a massive effort
to run an event that was just as wonderful as an in-person event would
have been.

This is a purely technical talk, and covers some very interesting
aspects of dealing with Galera high availability clusters for MySQL
and MariaDB database servers, connecting though them from Django via
an HAProxy load balancer, and then dealing with interesting side
effects of that combination.
