Summary: I presented two talks at DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2019: one 40-minute full-length talk, and a 5-minute Ignite.

This year, [DevOpsDays Tel Aviv](https://devopsdaystlv.com) accepted
two of my submitted talks:

## No really, don’t chuck everything in Slack: Communications for distributed teams

This is a 40-minute talk that I presented after keynotes on day 2. It
deals with the specific challenges that distributed teams face and
solve, and has a bunch of ready-to-go suggestions to communicate
better as a distributed team.

I had two surprises in this talk:

1. A large number of people still appear to be unfamiliar with the
   term [naked ping](https://blogs.gnome.org/markmc/2014/02/20/naked-pings/),
   even though just about everyone is _very_ familiar with the
   antipattern itself. It resulted in an “oh so _that’s_ what that’s
   called!” reaction from a significant share of the audience.

2. I usually try to not throw shade in my talks. But if and when I do
   it’s usually about Scrum, which I continue to consider a patently
   ludicrous idea. I did mention Scrum in a negative manner in my
   talk, and got a rather unexpected round of mid-talk applause. (My
   talks generally tend to be rather matter-of-factly; mid-sentence
   applause is not something I’m used to.) Speaking to a crowd that
   skewed hard toward the software engineering profession, this always
   gets me thinking: engineers understand that Scrum is horrible; when
   will their managers catch on?

The video for this talk is forthcoming, but for now you can find my
slides (with full speaker notes) on
[GitHub](https://fghaas.github.io/devopsdaystlv-2019/).


## Five is Fine: A case for small teams

This was a 5-minute talk delivered as part of a round of “Ignite”
talks. I use scare quotes because DevOpsDaysTLV uses a somewhat
relaxed Ignite format: you must deliver your talk in 5 minutes, but
you’re not restricted to the exact number of 20 slides, and your
slides also don’t auto-advance every 15 seconds. I did not know this,
so I _did_ follow the original Ignite format, using reveal.js
autoSlide to advance my slides every 15000 ms.

These talks were also recorded, and the recording should become
available relatively shortly (I will update this post when they
do). As with the other talk, the slides are available on 
[GitHub](https://fghaas.github.io/five-is-fine/) and include my notes.

I’d like to thank [Rachel](https://twitter.com/wholemilk) for
suggesting that I write this talk.


## Know a conference that might like these talks?

If you organize a conference that might be interested in including
these talks, or you’ve attended one that you _think_ might, please
[find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/xahteiwi) and let me
know. I’ll be happy to submit one of them for consideration. I could
definitely expand the Ignite talk into a full standard-length talk —
doing the reverse for the other one might be a bit challenging,
though.
