At linux.conf.au 2012, Florian I this presentation on the integration
of [DRBD](https://www.hastexo.com/drbd), Flashcache and
[Pacemaker](https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/high-availability/pacemaker)
in the High Availability and Distributed Storage miniconf.

In this 30-minute presentation, I explore the benefits of
[Flashcache](https://github.com/facebook/flashcache) for replicated
storage. Flashcache, [originally developed at
Facebook,](https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=388112370932) is a
general purpose, [block level cache device implemented in the Linux
device-mapper
framework.](https://github.com/facebook/flashcache/blob/master/doc/flashcache-doc.txt)
You can use flashcache in two distinct ways in Pacemaker
high-availability clusters, which I both explain in his talk.
