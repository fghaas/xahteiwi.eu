This presentation was delivered July 17, 2012 at OSCON in
Portland, Oregon.

I summarize high availability in OpenStack Folsom, particularly
OpenStack integration with the Pacemaker high availability cluster
stack.

I talk about high availability shortcomings in OpenStack Essex,
comparing OpenStack to some of its important competitors. I then
explain how these shortcomings are being addressed in Folsom, and give
an overview of the current progress in view of current OpenStack Folsom
development.
