A 45-minute talk I co-presented with [Madison
Kelly](https://alteeve.ca/w/Main_Page) at Linuxcon Europe 2011 in
Prague. We explain the purpose of fencing, options for implementing
fencing, and common pitfalls.

This presentation rounded out a series of high-availability talks at
Linuxcon Europe 2011, the first Linuxcon event hosted by the Linux
Foundation in Europe. Madison and I presented at the Clarion
Congress hotel, in the main conference track.
