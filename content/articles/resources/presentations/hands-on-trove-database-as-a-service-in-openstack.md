In order to make the most of this tutorial, you can recreate the
interactive steps presented. Please note: the process, while simple, is
extremely bandwidth intensive and you don't want to be the bandwidth hog
that everyone hates in your hotel, or on a conference wifi. Do so in
your office (or home) instead.

The set-up process is decribed in [a brief
README](https://github.com/fghaas/perconalive2014/blob/master/README.md).
Effectively, it boils down to cloning a Git repo and then running
vagrant up, and you'll be good to go. But do pay attention to the system
requirements.
