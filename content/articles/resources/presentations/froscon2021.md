Title: Add Depth! Stereoscopic imagery for everyone

Summary: My talk from FrOSCon 2021, Cloud Edition.

FrOSCon 2021 was again an online event due to the COVID-19 pandemic
([just like the previous year]({filename}froscon2020.md)), and had a
track named *Woodwork instead of IT*, showcasing people's hobbies and
interests they had discovered, or rediscovered, during lockdown.

So I submitted a talk that has absolutely nothing to do with what I do
for work, and instead covered stereography: making, and viewing,
stereoscopic images and videos.

The talk recording is available from [YouTube](https://youtu.be/5wh0IDdMvAk).
