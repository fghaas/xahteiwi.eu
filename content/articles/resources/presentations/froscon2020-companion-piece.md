[The original article]({filename}froscon2020.md) continues to prompt a
lot of thoughts and discussions, so I’ve written a a couple of
follow-up pieces:

1. [Getting out of Meeting
   Hell]({filename}../../blog/getting-out-of-meeting-hell.md) is a
   short series about getting from a distributed workplace that
   attempts to duplicate the synchronous nature of an office by
   sticking everyone into video meetings all the time — with usually
   disastrous results — to one that successfully adopts an
   asynchronous way of working. It has suggestions for employees,
   mid-level managers, and executives.

2. [Please, make my company
   distributed!]({filename}../../blog/make-my-company-distributed.md)
   takes a broader view on changing organizations so that they become
   better suited for a distributed and asynchronous style of work, and
   why that’s a lot harder than most people think.
