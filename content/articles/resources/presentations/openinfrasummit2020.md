Title: I Donâ€™t Think This Means What You Think It Means: Red Herrings in OpenStack
Date: 2020-10-22
Tags: Conference, OpenStack
Summary: My talk from the Open Infrastructure Summit, October 2020.

This is a talk of which I had done a previous version at Open Infra
Days Nordic in 2019, but where unfortunately the audio came out really
messed up in the recording. This version is much better.
