Title: No, really, don't chuck everything in Slack: communications for distributed teams

Summary: A talk I submitted to linux.conf.au 2019.

This is a talk I submitted[^1] to
[linux.conf.au](https://linux.conf.au/) 2019. The conference uses a
non-anonymized CfP process on a custom platform that, _I think,_ is
built on [Symposion](https://symposion.readthedocs.io/).

This talk was accepted as a _standby talk,_ meaning it was slated to
fill the gap if any other talk had to be cancelled on short notice. I
did prepare the full talk, though it did not end up presenting it at
the conference.

I also submitted the talk to [DjangoCon Europe
2019](https://2019.djangocon.eu), where it was rejected.

This is a personal story. It does not claim to be rooted in
statistical analysis or scientific rigour, and the evidence presented
is anecdotal. But it might be insightful to anyone joining, leaving,
or interacting with a remote team.

From 2011 to 2017, I ran a company that had no office. Everyone worked
from home, and apart from an annual one-week face to face meeting, all
our communications were remote. In 2017, I sold my company and
integrated my team into a company that had previously been working
exclusively out of a single office. As one would expect, the
integration was not without friction (they never are), but what
emerged from the experience was a better understanding of the
challenges that come with a mixed office/remote work environment, and
some rules to address them. In this talk, I'll cover:

* Typical misconceptions that remoties have about office-workers, and
  vice versa

* Using the right tools for the right type of communications:
  interactive chat, email, wiki, issue trackers, Kanban boards

* Timezones, and communications around scheduling

* The 5-paragraph format, a simple tool I habitually use to make sure
  everyone is on the same page

* Follow-up and follow-through, and how to make sure neither you, nor
  your team, nor your boss loses sight of what needs doing

It's probably good for me to reiterate that this is not a scientific study. :)
