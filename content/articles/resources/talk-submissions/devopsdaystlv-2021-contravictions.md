## Title

*On Contravictions*

## Elevator Pitch

> You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the
> "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

A contraviction is when a person firmly believes that two objectively
mutually exclusive standpoints are simultaneously true. Being
contravinced makes you extremely vulnerable to manipulation. Here’s
how to spot a contraviction, and what to do about them.

## Talk Format

## Description

"Contraviction" is a term I use for when a person is firmly convinced
of two sides of an obvious contradiction. This may sound like it would
be an unusual and rare occasion, and yet, once you start looking, they
are all over the place. A few examples:

* At the core of **Nazi ideology** in Germany in the 1920s and 30s was
  the notion that Jews are engaged in a *successful* global conspiracy
  to subjugate all nations including the German nation, and that Jews
  were also, *simultaneously,* socially, intellectually, economically,
  and morally inferior to Germans.

* At the core of **religious extremism** is the belief that God is
  all-forgiving and merciful, and also that as long as a portion of
  humanity ("infidels") displeases God, *all* of humanity must suffer
  God's wrath. We see this in contemporary Islamic extremism, but
  Catholicism in the 16th century did no better in the conquest of
  Latin America, nor did Western Christianity do much differently
  during the medieval crusades.

* At the core of **Trumpism** is the notion that the United States of
  America is the greatest nation on Earth and that there is no better
  nation nor will there ever be, but also that America has been ruined
  by "the liberals" and has slipped into inferiority, so that it is
  necessary to "make America great again."

In all these examples, both statements can logically be false, or one
of them *could* theoretically be true — but if one is true, the other
one *must* be false. And yet, people (*millions* of people!) hold or
held both of these statements to be true, simultaneously.

But being contravinced puts people in a very vulnerable position: if
someone gets you to believe both sides of a contradiction, they can
*logically* argue *anything* to follow from either one side, or the
opposite. Which means they can convince you of anything. And that
never ends well.

This talk defines contravictions, highlights examples (even devopsy
ones!) and provides suggestions on how to uncover and dismantle
them. Because contravictions have the potential to poison and destroy
discourse, and that’s a cultural issue we all need to deal with —
among friends, family, and coworkers.

## Notes

> Notes will only be seen by reviewers during the CFP process. This is
> where you should explain things such as technical requirements, why
> you're the best person to speak on this subject, etc...

Given the fact that the nature of this topic is sensitive and
emotional — yes I, an Austrian, will be talking about Nazi ideology,
in Israel, consider me terrified — I'll need to submit this on the
condition that I'd only want to deliver this talk *in person.* If that
does not permit itself on account of the Covid-19 situation or of
travel restrictions, and I would have to rely on a streamed talk and
have no way of reading the room or scanning the audience for body
language feedback (some more details on this topic
[here]({filename}../../blog/online-conferences-audience-feedback.md)),
then I'd rather not give the talk at all, rather than stream it.

If this disqualifies the talk (or if you just consider it too
controversial to begin with), no hard feelings at all.
