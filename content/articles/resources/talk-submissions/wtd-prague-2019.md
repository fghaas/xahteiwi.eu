## Talk title

_Writing for learners: best practices for creating, developing, and
maintaining self-paced learning resources._

## Talk abstract

> More information here is better. Submitting a single paragraph won't
> give us much to go on, but please no walls of text.

This presentation talks about a special kind of tech writing: creating
and maintaining self-paced technical training content. This
encompasses both prose for theoretical background information, and
instructions for hands-on labs.

In this talk, I’ll go over

- special challenges (and advantages!) of self-directed over
  instructor-driven training
- video content, and why we don’t do it
- our rules for structuring theoretical content
- our approach for interactive lab instructions

This is rooted in 4 years’ experience in writing courseware used for
learning complex technical topics (like OpenStack, Kubernetes, Ceph,
and others) on an Open edX platform.

You’ll find the concepts discussed in this talk useful if you write
courseware (of course), but I’d say they equally apply whenever you
find yourself writing any content that is instructive, rather than
descriptive.

## Who and why 

> Who is this talk for? What background knowledge or experience do you
> expect the audience to have? What is the take away from the talk?

This talk is for anyone who, in a technical context, uses
imperatives. I’ve been at least a part-time tech writer for the better
part of the last 10 years, but I’ve written software documentation for
only 4 of those – the majority of the remainder I’ve written
courseware content instead. 

Writing prose training content and lab instructions comes with its own
unique challenges and its own (explicit or implicit) style
guide. Since as courseware authors we communicate with our learners
exclusively in writing, I believe I have good practices to share with
other documentarians who might occasionally find themselves in the
situation of writing lab instructions and test scenario descriptions,
and I think there are equally many things that can learn from other
talks and speakers.

## Other Information

> Any other information that might be interesting for us to know about
> you? Give a lightning talk last year, speak at a WTD meetup, or
> anything else interesting? Add it here.

I’ve never spoken at any Write The Docs conference, though I have done
talks and workshops at multiple instances of linux.conf.au, LinuxCon
(now Open Source Summit), OpenStack Summit (now Open Infrastructure
Summit), the Open edX Conference, and others.

My team and I maintain City Cloud Academy (academy.citycloud.com),
which runs on Open edX.
