Summary: A workshop I submitted to Open Infra Days Nordics 2019.

This is a workshop I proposed[^1] for [OpenInfra Days
Nordics](https://openinfranordics.com/), via a non-anonymized CfP
process using [PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/).

## Title

_One For All: Using Terraform to manage OpenStack and Kubernetes
resources_

## Elevator Pitch

> You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the
> "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

A hands-on introduction to Terraform in an OpenStack and Kubernetes
context. Get the basics (of Terraform), then spin up a Kubernetes
cluster in an OpenStack public cloud (with Terraform), and manage
resources on it (with Terraform).

## Talk Format

Workshop (>60 minutes)

## Audience Level

Intermediate

## Description

If you are interested in deployment automation for arbitrarily complex
containerized microservice applications, this is for you!

In this workshop, you will

* get to know the basics of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and
  [Terraform
  configurations](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/),
* spin up a Kubernetes cluster with Terraform, using the [OpenStack
  provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/) and
  interfacing with [OpenStack
  Magnum](https://docs.openstack.org/magnum/latest/user/) in a public
  cloud,
* start managing Kubernetes resources from Terraform, using the
  [Kubernetes
  provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/kubernetes/).
  
You'll walk away with a solid understanding of Terraform's
capabilities, enabling you to make an informed decision of whether
Terraform is a suitable deployment automation facility for your
organization's needs.

Prior Terraform knowledge is not required.

## Notes

> This field supports Markdown. Notes will only be seen by reviewers
> during the CFP process. This is where you should explain things such
> as technical requirements, why you're the best person to speak on
> this subject, etc...

There are no technical requirements other than internet connectivity,
and a web browser (preferably on a laptop, though a reasonably-sized
tablet with a modern browser should work as well).
## Tags

> Tag your talk to make it easier for event organizers to be able to
> find. Examples are "ruby, javascript, rails".
