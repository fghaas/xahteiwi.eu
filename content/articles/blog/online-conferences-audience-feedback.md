Summary: As a speaker, I look for something very specific in online conference platforms. 

We are in year 2 of the Covid-19 pandemic, and open-source conferences
are still, for the most part, online-only events. (And I find myself
questioning the judgment of those that put on large in-person
conferences.) I have spoken at several of such conferences, and I'd
like to zero in on one aspect of my *personal* experience, *as a
speaker,* on some of the conference platforms I worked with.

Now, I should explain one thing up front. As a speaker, the thing I
care the most about is:

### Is this talk useful to you?

That's it. That's the paramount question. I want you to take something
away from the talk *that you find useful.* Whether that's a technical
insight, or a new angle on a problem, or even just entertainment, I
want there to be something in the talk *for you.*

And it's incredibly important for me to get a sense of that, as I am
delivering the talk.

Now in an in-person event, that's easy: all I need is a look across
the room, and I *permanently* look across the room. I can tell if
you're making eye contact, or listening intently, or nodding your
head, or even putting on a face that makes it clear that you're
violently disagreeing with me. Sure, if you raise your hand and ask a
question, or heckle me, or laugh at a joke, that drives the point of
your engagement home ‚Äî but I don't need you to become so *explicitly*
engaged, to know *that* you are engaged.

And it is *this kind of feedback* (that you might not even realize
you're giving me!) that makes the difference between delivering a
talk, and just speaking into the void. It's also the difference
between delivering a conference talk, even if it's a pre-recorded one,
and just uploading the video on YouTube. If an conference platform
doesn't give me that kind of feedback channel, the work that I put
into writing, rehearsing, and recording/streaming the talk is better
spent with a view toward upload to a video hosting platform, and
engaging with viewers there.

So, I as a speaker am foremost interested in a single thing about the
conference platform:

### Is it easy for you to tell me if my talk is useful to you?

And I'm not talking about you getting into a chat and saying "this is
useful." That's much too high of a threshold. How often do you sit in
a talk and then *tell* the speaker, "hey, that's useful"? Quite
rarely, and only if you find the content *especially* actionable or
insightful. Because you normally don't *have to* tell me explicitly:
if you're actively listening to me, I can tell. And I know you
wouldn't be listening to me if I talked useless nonsense.

And this is one of the reasons why I like
[Venueless](https://venueless.org/en/) so much. Venueless has
implemented an extremely low-threshold feature of showing audience
engagement. You get a handful of emoji like ‚ù§Ô∏èüëèü§£üëçü§î that you, as a
viewer, can click on, and then they appear in the event chat stream
like "emoji rain" from the top of the screen. Just one click, which
also gets anonymized and lost in the crowd ‚Äî this last bit is
important for people who are shy or reserved, and don't like to stick
their head out. And this makes it so much easier for you to engage,
than having to actually type a sentence (or even a word, or even
*typing* an emoji) into a chat channel.

*I can not tell you enough how much of a difference this makes to the
speaker experience.* Add to this that the event chat is *not* shackled
to Slack or any other horribly overgrown not-even-really-chat platform
anymore, and you've got a simple, easy-to-use, no-unnecessary-frills
experience that puts you *directly* in touch with your audience. I
loved this at [PyCon AU](https://2020.pycon.org.au/) last year.

For comparison, I also saw [LoudSwarm](https://loudswarm.com/) at
[DjangoCon Europe](https://2021.djangocon.eu/). The way it was used in
that conference it seemed very tightly tied to Slack, although the
audience was very nice in using emoji reactions very
generously. Still, it wasn't the same quality of feedback that
Venueless provided.

[Voctoconf](https://github.com/lukas2511/voctoconf), which I saw at
FrOSCon, allegedly predates Venueless and was excellent in terms of
streaming, but in terms of audience interaction it's essentially
[BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/) on steroids, meaning it's
about on the same level as the LoudSwarm/Slack combination I saw at
DjangoCon.
