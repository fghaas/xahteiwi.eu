For the upcoming OpenStack Summit in Portland, Syed Armani and I have
[submitted a
talk](https://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/vote-for-speakers/presentation/531)
on OpenStack high availability. Here's how you can make sure it makes it
into the program.

Our talk,Â ***More reliable, more resilient, more redundant: High
Availability Update for Grizzly and beyond,*** is an extended overview
about current and future high availability features in OpenStack. It
covers infrastructure high availability, HA features in Nova, Quantum,
and several other topics.

I've given a shorter version of this talk [just this week, at the 2nd
Swiss OpenStack User Group
meetup,](https://www.hastexo.com/resources/presentations/high-availability-update-grizzly-and-havana)
where apparently [around 55 people liked it a
lot.](http://www.meetup.com/zhgeeks/events/97648722/) You can take a
look at the slides
[here,](https://www.hastexo.com/resources/presentations/high-availability-update-grizzly-and-havana)
and there will also be a video that should be available later this week.

So, to make sure that this talk makes it into the Summit, we need your
help! Voting for Summit sessions is up, and you can vote for our talk
[here.](https://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/vote-for-speakers/presentation/531)
Please note, you must be an OpenStack Foundation member to vote. If
you're not, and you're into OpenStack, you can [join (for free!) as an
Individual Member.](https://www.openstack.org/join/register/) Then, you
can immediately [proceed to the voting
page](https://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/vote-for-speakers/presentation/531)
to cast your vote.

Thanks for your support, and we hope to see you in Portland!
