I just learned that my presentation is going ahead at the [OpenStack
Spring 2012
Conference](http://www.openstack.org/conference/san-francisco-2012/).

My presentation, *Reliable, Redundant: High Availability in
OpenStack,* has been accepted for the main conference track. The
official schedule isn't yet up pending confirmation from all speakers,
but I've been tentatively informed that it's on at 11:30 am on Friday,
April 20.

This of course means that you should totally [register for the
conference](http://www.openstack.org/conference/san-francisco-2012/register/)
if you haven't already done so, and I'll be happy to chat with anyone
interested in OpenStack HA. See you in San Francisco!
