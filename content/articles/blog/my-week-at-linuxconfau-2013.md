linux.conf.au 2013 has kicked off this morning, and here is a brief
preview of my talks and related activities this week.

This afternoon, as part of the [Cloud, Distributed Storage and High
Availability
miniconf,](https://lca2013.linux.org.au/wiki/Miniconfs/CloudDistributedStorageandHighAvailability)
I am moderating the [Grand Distributed Storage
Debate](https://lca2013.linux.org.au/wiki/Miniconfs/CloudDistributedStorageandHighAvailability).
In this debate, we'll have Sage Weil (for Ceph) and John Mark Walker
(for GlusterFS) go head-to-head about the merits of their respective
projects.

On Tuesday, during the [OpenStack
miniconf,](http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30100/view_talk?day=tuesday)
I'm doing a talk on integrating Ceph with OpenStack.

Finally, on Friday afternoon, Tim Serong and I are scheduled to do [a
full hands-on Ceph
tutorial.](http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30091/view_talk?day=friday)
Watch this space, we'll announce where to download your VM images no
later than Wednesday (as soon as we've figured out just where in the
conference network we can upload it).
