Summary: A breakfast experiment that turned out well.

Sometime last year I came across a post on
[/r/food](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/) that I seem to be unable to
dig up. However, I recall that it had an infographic asserting that
for a salad to be perfect, it had to have

* something tangy,
* something sweet,
* something crunchy,
* some protein (egg or meat),
* some dairy (yoghurt or cheese).

So I goofed around preparing breakfast one Sunday morning, and out
came this.

## Ingredients

Amounts are per person. Multiply as needed.

Salad:

* A fistful of [rocket
  leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_leaves) (arugula).
* Some grapes, the smaller the better.
* A few cherry tomatoes. Best fresh off the vine in the middle of
  summer, even better if you can mix red, yellow, and purple
  varieties.
* A few basil leaves.
  * A small amount of your favorite cold cut, say a thin slice or two of
  [prosciutto crudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto) or
  [bresaola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresaola) (or
  [Bündnerfleisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCndnerfleisch),
  if you want to get super fancy).
* A few thin slices of Parmigiano or Grana Padano. Cutting them off
  the piece with a potato peeler works really well.
* Pinch of black sesame seeds.
  

Vinaigrette:

* 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
* Pinch of salt
* A few turns of freshly ground black pepper
* Half a teaspoon of mustard
* Half a teaspoon of honey
* A dash of something spicy, if you’re into that sort of thing. Sambal
  oelek or sriracha sauce will work just fine.
* 3 teaspoons olive oil

Omelette:

* 1 egg
* Pinch of salt
* Butter (for frying)


## Equipment

* 1 medium-size bowl
* 2 small bowls
* Whisk
* Small frying pan


## Method

1. Prepare the tomatoes: using a properly sharp kitchen knife, cut
   them into halves, quarters, or slices. Chuck them into a small bowl
   and sprinkle them rather liberally with salt and black
   pepper. Stack the basil leaves on top of each other and roll them
   up like tobacco leaves for a cigar, then cut the rolls into slices
   as thinly as you can. Throw the thin basil strands into the bowl,
   add some olive oil, and mix thoroughly using a spoon or your
   hands. Let the bowl sit on the countertop for five minutes or so,
   so that the tomatoes start oozing a bit of juice.

2. Make the vinaigrette: in a wide-enough bowl, put in salt, pepper,
   mustard, honey, and balsamic vinegar, and optionally the spicy
   condiment. Whisk to mix nicely, then add olive oil and whisk
   vigorously for 30-60 seconds. The goal is to get an opaque
   emulsion, with the mustard and honey acting as natural
   [emulsifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion#Emulsifiers).

3. Throw the rocket leaves and grapes into the vinaigrette bowl and
   mix thoroughly with (cleanly washed) hands. Let sit for a few
   minutes so that the vinaigrette can infuse the leaves.

4. Crack egg into a small bowl, beat thoroughly with the whisk so the
   mixture is homogenous. Add a bit of salt.
   
5. Make sure your serving plate, pieces of meat, cheese shavings, and
   black sesame are close by (if you’re a
   [mise-en-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place)
   enthusiast, you’ve likely done this already) — once the omelette is
   ready, you want to serve things up quickly.

6. Heat up some butter in the small pan.

7. Pour the beaten egg in and cook your omelet. It will be very thin
   so this should take only a minute, perhaps two.

8. Throw the omelet on the plate (don’t fold it) and then start
   stacking: rocket and grapes in vinaigrette at the bottom, then
   tomatoes in olive oil and basil, meat, cheese shavings finally
   sesame on top.

9. Serve.
