Summary: Next Tuesday, the European Parliament is due to vote on something that will impact your life. Yes, yours.

On Tuesday, March 26 at half-past noon Central European Time, the
European Parliament is due to vote on an issue that will definitely
impact your life, no matter if you live in or outside the EU. No, it
has nothing to do with Brexit. Brexit has just managed to monopolise
your attention. The Tuesday vote has much more far-reaching
consequences.

## What’s going on here?

On Tuesday, the EP will vote on a Directive “on copyright and related
rights in the Digital Single Market”, the draft of which you can look
up
[here](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2018-0245-AM-271-271_EN.pdf)
(PDF in English), also known as [the **EU Copyright
Directive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market).

Now this thing attempts to be a 21st-century copyright law, which is
laudable, but it does absolutely awful things: go take a look at [this
video](https://youtu.be/CyUh9wOp_Rw) to get the quick run-down. It’ll
only take 4 minutes of your time. And as you’ll see from the video,
**this law will have a devastating global impact** on society at
large. (While completely failing to achieve its ostensible goals, mind
you.)

What is apparent from the discussion around this directive is that it
isn’t being pushed by exceptionally clueful people. One MEP in favor
of the directive once publicly surmised that he was dealing with a
concerted campaign from Google, [because lots of the email in his
inbox came from `gmail.com`
addresses](https://twitter.com/schulzeeuropa/status/1096445520770404352). The
[rapporteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committees_of_the_European_Parliament)
on the directive [hasn’t subscribed to any YouTube channel and thinks
that there is a Memes section on
Google](https://www.vice.com/de/article/vbw8zy/streit-um-uploadfilter-und-artikel13-wie-axel-voss-das-internet-sieht),
and when properly roasted on Twitter, someone representing
his party [publicly doubled
down](https://twitter.com/CDU_CSU_EP/status/1108372306101968901) on
his behalf.

In the words of Janus Kopfstein:

> [It’s no longer OK to not know how the internet
> works.](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pggamb/dear-congress-it-s-no-longer-ok-to-not-know-how-the-internet-works-5886b6cbc860fd45c9f2dfe3)

Yes, he wrote that in 2011, and addressed at the U.S. Congress, but
here we are, with our European representatives still needing that
reminder 8 years on.

They even tried the oldest trick in the book: once all of Europe
started screaming about Article 13, they renumbered. So **what used to
be Article 13 is now Article 17.** Don’t get confused; this is just a
ploy by people who print out emails.

Now luckily, the backers of Article 17 are opposed by a good bunch of
people who are clued in, and have pledged to strike this Directive
down in the EP on Tuesday. 

## OK. So what do I do?

You can [sign a change.org
petition](https://www.change.org/p/european-parliament-stop-the-censorship-machinery-save-the-internet). It
already has 5 million supporters, and there will likely be many
more. But supporting that petition **is not enough.**

You can check out your own MEPs for their status at [Pledge
2019](https://pledge2019.eu/). And you can lean on them: Pledge 2019
lets you call the people whose job it is to represent **you** in the
EP, and if they haven’t pledged to reject the Directive in its current
form, **you can let them know** (in no uncertain terms) **that you
won’t be voting for them or their party in the upcoming [EP
elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Parliament_election)**
in May.

Also, there’s [Save Your
Internet](https://saveyourinternet.eu/act/). The primary spin your
pro-upload filter reps are trying to put on the discussion is that
the legislation isn’t opposed by an appreciable number of real people,
and that only astroturfing bots want this law struck down. You can
**write an email, send a letter** (yes, a letter, as in, snail mail), or
**call them.**

And finally, [Save The Internet](https://savetheinternet.info/demos)
(yes, everyone’s, not just yours). March 23 is a day of pan-European
protest against Article 17. **Find a rally and go.**
