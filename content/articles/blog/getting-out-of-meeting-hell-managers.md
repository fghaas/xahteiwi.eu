This part of this series is for you if you are a manager at any level
of your organization *except the very top.* In other words, you have
reports, but you also report to someone. And as such you may be stuck
in meeting hell in two ways:

1. With your own team, that is to say, yourself and the people
   reporting to you.
2. With your management peers, in other words, the people that manage
   other teams and report to the same director, VP, or whatever other
   fancy titles your company might use.

And I’ll cover both of those angles, but before I do, I should note
that you, of course, have one option to improve your personal
situation that is [also available to your
reports]({filename}getting-out-of-meeting-hell-employees.md):
**Leave.** It’s not the only option you have, and it may not be your
*first* option, but an option it is. And, for your personal
development, taking on a management role in a company that does
distributed work and asynchronous communications right might be an
excellent career move.

If you are a conscientious manager and you feel a sense of
responsibility and obligation to your team, and this makes you
hesitate to consider the option to leave, then that reflects nobly on
your character but know this: that responsibility is contigent on
everyone’s employment in one organization, and it ends the day your
employment contract (or theirs) terminates. That may sound harsh, but
that’s the breaks of the game, and you shouldn’t let that hold you up,
if leaving is the objectively most sensible option for you. There’s no
use burning out over an exaggerated sense of duty.

In addition, I'd posit that you *should* leave your company if it
employs or promotes employee surveillance, keeps voodoo "meeting
engagement metrics", or engages in otherwise harmful or toxic
behavior. I'd argue that in those cases you should also make sure your
direct reports know why you're leaving, to the extent that your
contractual obligations allow you to tell them.[^non-disparagement]

[^non-disparagement]: By the way: if your non-disparagement clause is
	so harsh that you can't talk about *anything* negative in the
	company, then that's probably an awful company to begin with.

However, if you’ve chosen *not* to leave your current organization,
and you want to actually do the hard work for making work
*better* for yourself and your distributed team, here is your
paramount obligation:

## Learn.

If there’s anything that the coronavirus pandemic has shown about
organizations making the (admittedly abrupt) transition from localized
to distributed work, it’s this: it’s a challenge for managers much
more than for non-manager employees. You have to make a conscious
effort to learn how distributed work works, and how you manage a
distributed team.

But, chances are that you won’t be limited to watching talks or
listening to podcasts or reading articles (you might have [read this
one]({filename}../resources/presentations/froscon2020.md) before you
landed here). Instead, it’s not unlikely that if you’re doing software
or technology development, some of the people on your team are already
well versed in distributed collaboration and asynchronous
communications. Yes, I am of course talking about open source
contributors. It absolutely does not matter *what kind* of open source
software some on your team have worked or helped out on, or whether
it’s in any way related to the products your company builds. Everyone
who’s ever landed a pull request probably has had to learn more about
distributed, async communications than any office dweller did who
never has. Find those people. Talk to them. Learn from them.

You’ll also have peers in the industry, outside your company. Managers
who’ve already done the work. They can’t do the *learning* for you,
but they can you show a few tricks of the trade.

And I’ll give you one, straight away: in a company stuck in Meeting
Hell, you change things for your team first, and don’t even think
about people at or above your level.  I would not advise taking your
ideas up the chain without the confidence of knowing that what you are
suggesting works in *your* team. Mid-level management is unfortunately
often full of “great idea, but it’ll never work here” or “that might
sound nice, but I’m afraid it doesn’t fit our culture.” You want to
run silent, run deep (if you permit me a strained metaphor). When your
team lands its first great big success, *that’s* when you casually
want to drop something like “we did this on one meeting a week.”

So, how can you get there? Here are a few ideas.

* Eliminate daily standups.

* Limit yourself to one scheduled team meeting a week. Keep it to
  approximately one hour, give or take a few minutes. Schedule it near
  the start of the work week (meaning, in most countries, on Monday).

* Have an agenda for your team meeting (and *all* other meetings) that
  is available in a collaboratively editable document,
  cross-referencing all open tasks. Have this agenda in a place where
  everyone can find it, and have it ready no later than 15 minutes
  prior to the meeting.

* During the meeting, transform the agenda into your meeting
  notes. This is something a collaboratively editable document (like a
  wiki page or Google Doc) makes easy. Appoint a responsible
  note-taker or scribe, whose job it is to compile the meeting notes,
  edit minor glitches and errors, and then let you know the notes are
  ready for consumption. You may decide that *everyone* who is in the
  meeting can co-edit the notes, and this can be very beneficial to
  make sure that even the quiet voices are heard. But it’s the
  scribe’s responsibility to bring them into good shape, and it’s your
  responsibility as the team lead to make sure they’re truthful and
  accurate.

* Spend the first 15-20 minutes of the weekly meeting on non-work
  topics. Ask something like "how was your weekend" or "how are things
  going in your part of the world" or anything else that you can think
  of that helps you feel the mood of your team. These things don’t go
  on the meeting record. Always accept when people don't want to give
  an answer. They may have many reasons, none of which are necessarily
  your business. Trust that they'll share whatever they're comfortable
  sharing, even if some weeks that's nothing.

* Learn to keep each other appraised of your relative progress and
  status via a simple, central coordination facility, such as a
  virtual Kanban board.

* Learn to [write to be
  understood](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/41002-writing-to-be-understood/),
  and encourage your team to do the same.

* Do not attempt to get back to people "immediately", and do not
  expect people to get back to you promptly. A reasonable default
  expectation for reply times is 24 hours. If you need an answer
  faster, you can always send an email (or better still, a comment on
  a card or ticket) with a request like "if I could get this by 1600
  UTC today, that'd be excellent." Bonus points if you add *why* you
  need that information quickly, as in "... so I can put this together
  with Kim's performance data and make a decision on which load
  balancing strategy we'll use, which Alex needs to know by tomorrow."

* Establish a convention for marking things as urgent, when
  needed. The word *URGENT*, included in capital letters in an email
  subject or a chat message, usually works well. *Only* use this if
  things are on fire.[^not-urgent-by-default] *Never* use the urgency
  marker just by itself. (That's a [naked
  ping](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/No_naked_pings) on steroids.)
  Also, when someone legitimately uses the marker in communication
  with *you,* honour it. When someone uses it for something other than
  a legitimate reason, take them to task.

* Get used to referring back to written communication, such as ticket
  comments or the record of a meeting, weeks or months later. This is
  not “pulling out the receipts” or “quoting chapter and verse” at
  someone. It simply serves to establish that yes, we have a written
  record of just about everything, and there is no need to keep these
  things stored in our heads under a banner saying “must not forget”
  (the latter being a major contributor to personal stress).

* Don’t attempt to hide your own mistakes and misjudgements. They’re
  on the record. That makes them a learning opportunity.

* Gradually establish firm communication rules with your team. Many of
  these won’t need to be autocratically decreed, because they just
  make sense and people tend to intuitively agree on them (like the
  just-mentioned *URGENT* marker and the circumstances under which to
  use them). Then, make sure you [stick to
  them]({filename}rules-are-rules.md). Stick to them yourself, and
  correct others who break them.[^asshole-filter]

[^not-urgent-by-default]: Note that the convention of the *URGENT*
	marker also establishes the convention that things are *not*
	urgent by default.
	
[^asshole-filter]: Failure to enforce sensible collaboration rules may
  result in the inadvertent creation of an [asshole
  filter](https://siderea.livejournal.com/1230660.html). “Oh but I
  can't enforce that rule on Bob, because Bob thinks rules aren't for
  him but he's brilliant!” — No. [Don't tolerate brilliant
  jerks](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-11-13/brilliant-jerks.html).

Importantly, *let your team know* that you're working on getting them
*all* out of meeting hell. Don't sugarcoat things if you're struggling
while swimming against the company tide, at least temporarily. If they
know you're actively striving to make their work situation better, more
productive *and healthier* it may well make the difference between
[them leaving]({filename}getting-out-of-meeting-hell-employees.md) and
staying on board.

Finally, keep an eye on corporate policy and the messages you get from
company leadership. If they're obviously stuck in 1995, you might as
well go and update your CV. If the people at the top do [make an
effort to implement distributed and async friendly
policies]({filename}getting-out-of-meeting-hell-executives.md),
however, then things may not change overnight, but there’s hope that
change they will, and your effort will not be for naught.
