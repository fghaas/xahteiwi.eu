Early next month, I'll be off to Barcelona for speaking at LinuxCon
Europe. Here's an overview of my talks.

November 5-7, the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/) is
holding the annual [LinuxCon
Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe) in one
of Europe's most beautiful cities — some say *the* most beautiful —
Barcelona. I will be attending the full conference, and presenting two
talks.

Wednesday, November 7, is a day full of tutorials at LinuxCon Europe. I
am presenting [Hands-On with Ceph: Object Storage, Block Storage,
Filesystem &
More](http://linuxconeurope2012.sched.org/event/83ef77ad003a026246f37e639cd562db),
a deep dive into the Ceph stack. This is a double-slot tutorial,
scheduled for 2:45 - 4:25pm in the Verdi room.

Then on Thursday, the GlusterFS community team has invited me to speak
at the [Gluster
Workshop.](http://linuxconeurope2012.sched.org/overview/type/gluster+workshop) This
workshop is complimentary to [registered LinuxCon Europe
attendees](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe/attend/register),
but you can also [register
separately](https://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1109147)
just for the workshop. In that talk, I'll speak about [GlusterFS in High
Availability Clusters: Integration with the Pacemaker HA
Stack](http://linuxconeurope2012.sched.org/event/2b898583721726bd6a8d8e15af2084d8).
It's also a 1-hour slot, from 10 - 11am in Vivaldi.

I'm pretty excited about this trip: it's close to home, it's a great
conference, and I've never been to Barcelona before. So, if you're
headed there, please [drop me a
note](https://www.hastexo.com/users/florian/contact) and let me know so
we can catch up. Thanks — see you there!
