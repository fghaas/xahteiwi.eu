Summary: A short series on transitioning to distributed work and asynchronous collaboration. This article is the introduction.

In 2020, I presented a talk at [FrOSCon](https://www.froscon.de)
titled [No, we won’t have a video call for that: Communications for
distributed
teams.](https://media.ccc.de/v/froscon2020-2605-no_we_won_t_have_a_video_call_for_that)
In early 2021 I put together a full-length writeup of that talk, and
[published it
here]({filename}../resources/presentations/froscon2020.md). And for no
apparent reason that article then [made it to the top of Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28636536) on one day in
September 2021,[^newsy] and apparently [resonated with quite a few
people](https://twitter.com/xahteiwi/status/1442371424543444994).

[^newsy]: For context: it was at the top for like three hours on a
	Saturday morning. So it might have landed there just because
    enough people were simultaneously bored enough to give it a
    read...

And after that, I got a fair number of questions along the lines of
“okay, what you talk about is a spot-on description of how I *want* to
work, but how do I get there?” In other words, **what can you do in
order to transition from a team that's stuck in meeting hell, to one
that actually goes fully distributed and embraces asynchronous
communications?**

> **Note:** I use the shorthand *Meeting Hell* for a situation in

[^in-person-meeting]: Meeting Hell might *also* apply to excessive
    in-person meetings in a shared work space, such as an
    office. However, I really don't believe my industry will ever go
    back to defaulting to office-based work, now that it has shown for
    nearly two years that it *can* function, in principle, in a
    default-distributed mode. Thus, I am using the word "meeting" as
    synonymous with "video meeting" in this series, and I wouldn't be
    surprised if this eventually became the norm.
	
	Think of this as
    akin to the transition undergone by the word *call:* before
    the advent of the telephone, a *call* was a visit you paid to
    someone's house. Then, if you metaphorically "visited" someone by
    telephone, that was a *telephone call*. Now a *call* is always a
    phone call, except when explicitly specified as a *house call.*

So what I’m doing here is offer **suggestions** for getting out of that. If

* you’re one of the people that has 25 meetings a week, or
* you [spend 60% of your work
  week](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28652514) in standups and
  planning and retro, or
* the only time you have for doing what you actually signed up for [is
  in overtime](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28653696),

and it’s grinding you down, and you want to work differently, then
this series might be for you.

### Personal strategies: one size does not fit all

I think it’s very important to **differentiate personal strategies** for
getting to distributed & async, based on your position in the company
or organization. So, I’m going to look at it from three angles:

1. Your options if you are what some companies call an “Individual
   Contributor”, or IC. In other words, these are for you if you are a
   **regular employee** (or contractor), and you’re *not* personally
   responsible for other people — in other words, you have no reports.

2. Your options if you are at some level of **management** that is
   *not* top organizational leadership. That is to say, you have
   people that report to you, but you also report to someone.

3. Your options if you’re a **top-level executive**, meaning you’re a
   Chief Executive Officer or Managing Director or Executive Director
   or something of the sort. You have people that report to you, but
   you don’t directly report to anyone — even though you may be
   answerable to a Board of Directors or some other oversight body, of
   course.

### These are my views, not self-evident truths

Now, I’m only going to talk about my industry (software-driven
technology) because that’s the only industry I feel remotely qualified
to talk about. Also, I have never worked in a company that had more
than 3,000 employees, and I feel most at home in small outfits under
50. I’m reasonably confident that what I talk about is somewhat useful
for companies from 3 to 3,000 people in the software industry. It
*may* be applicable elsewhere — larger companies, other industries —
but at any rate, I make no guarantees of any kind. Feel free to adopt
an entirely contrarian position. And, you should also know I am not a
scientist, so none of what I write is informed by rigorous empiricism.

So, are we cool with that? **My opinion, my thoughts, my views — not
pronouncements of absolute truth.**

Let’s get started.
