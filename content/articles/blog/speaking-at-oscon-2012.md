I'll be speaking at [OSCON 2012](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012) in
Portland, on high availability in
[OpenStack](https://www.hastexo.com/knowledge/openstack).

I learned from O'Reilly yesterday that my presentation proposal for this
year's [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012), which takes place July
16-20, 2012 in Portland, Oregon, has been accepted. As this is my first
OSCON speaking slot (actually, it's my first OSCON altogether), this is
a thrilling speaking opportunity for me.

My talk, *Highly Available Cloud: OpenStack integration with Pacemaker*
is currently (tentatively, I suppose) scheduled for 11:30 on July 18.
