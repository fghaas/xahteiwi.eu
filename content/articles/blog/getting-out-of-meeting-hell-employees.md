Summary: A short series on transitioning to distributed work and asynchronous collaboration. This article is on what you can do if you are stuck in meeting hell as a regular employee who isn't in a management role.

So, you're a regular employee (sometimes called an *Individual
Contributor* or IC), who doesn't have a team that reports to you. And
you are in an organization that, although it does have remote
employees or may even have switched to an all-distributed mode on
account of the pandemic, does not adopt basic rules of
distributed work and asynchronous communications.

You spend more time in meetings than is healthy, your productivity is
severely impacted, you're stressed out from frequent interruptions,
you have trouble getting into a state of
[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). You may be
asked to keep your camera on for hours at a time, and you feel that
this badly encroaches on your privacy or sense of personal space. Your
manager or your peers like to
[naked-ping](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/No_naked_pings) you or
send you "hey, I need you for a minute" one-liners that [disrupt your
train of
thought](https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/)
for half an hour.

And your organization (including your peers and direct manager)
tolerate or condone this kind of collaboration.

If that sounds like your typical day, I have great news for you. You
have at hand an excellent opportunity to improve your personal
situation, be more productive, and communicate better with your peers:

## Leave.

Hand in your notice. Quit. Hightail it outta there. If 

* you want to truly improve your personal situation and work
  effectively in a distributed team, *and*
* neither your direct manager nor the top leadership of the
  organization takes any interest in optimizing for distributed and
  asynchronous collaboration,

then the way to do that *for yourself* is to leave your current
organisation behind, and go elsewhere. There's plenty of employment
opportunities for you to pick up in this industry at this time, and
there are a number of organizations that handle distributed work
better than the one you're currently in.

Sure, you could consider trying to change the system from within. And
there is a small (I'd say minute, but nonzero) probability that you'll
be successful, and drive real change in your organization. However,
there is an inordinately *larger* probability that you'll burn out in
the process — and endangering your health is never a gamble that's
worth taking.

You may think that that’s a pessimistic view. I think the opposite is
true. You’re not “failing” to drive change in an organization that
resists it, instead you can succeed at pushing change in an
organization that embraces it. Throwing your energy into meaningful
change for the better is the definition of optimism, in my book. And
if the place for that is elsewhere from where you are now, seize that
opportunity!

However, note that the foregoing is all predicated on the entire
company (including your direct manager) being *fine* with synchronous
work and people having their calendar jammed with back-to-back
meetings, with no apparent intent to change. If it’s just you that
wants change, or perhaps only you and people at your level in *other*
teams that you can’t reasonably join forces with, I’d argue that you
just shouldn’t be risking your health. In contrast, if your
manager[^direct-manager] and a couple of your peers are on your side —
consider your manager may be in their own
[learning]({filename}getting-out-of-meeting-hell-managers.md) phase
about distributed and async collaboration — then things are a lot less
clean cut, and maybe you’d want to stay on for the ride. Particularly
so if there's an active, supportive push [from the
top]({filename}getting-out-of-meeting-hell-executives.md) of the
organization.

*Even if* your manager and some of your peers are on your side, I can
think of a few situations where you should still leave: like when your
company has an “always on camera” policy, or doesn’t allow people to
go audio-only on calls, or promotes [number crunching on employee
“engagement” in a meeting
app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/teams-reporting-reference). Companies
doing that are, in my view, beyond salvation and will never be able to
attain the levels of trust required for a distributed organization to
function.

So: if you’re stuck in meeting hell with nobody on your side, as a
regular employee with no reports, your best way forward is probably
the way to the exit. If you're stuck in meeting hell *now* but there's
a gale blowing the company into async & distributed mode, and/or you
have a very thick-skinned manager that gets it, and will deflect and
absorb any pressure from meeting-addicted higher-ups, you may want to
hang on for the journey.

[^direct-manager]: I’d posit that the only manager that really matters
    in this scenario is your *direct* line manager. That person would
    your make-or-break partner in any transformation of how your team
    collaborates. If you and they don’t share views, then don’t expect
    to be able to play four-dimensional chess by forming an alliance
    with some *other* manager who you then expect to influence *your*
    manager so that *everyone* gets better at distributed and async
    work. You don’t want to trade being stuck in meeting hell for
    being in stuck in meeting hell *and corporate politics.*
