Summary: My go-to recipe for pan (deep dish) pizza.

I’ve found this to be the pan pizza to end all pan pizzas. It’s my
standard pizza dough recipe, plus some inspiration from [this
video](https://youtu.be/uYxB4QBlrx4). The trick with seasoning the pan
is an absolute kicker and makes the crust taste oodles better than
without that seasoning.

## Ingredients

Amounts are for one 26 cm pan that will likely feed 4 adults. Make
several to accommodate a larger crowd, or very hungry people.

Crust:

* 200g plain spelt flour[^1]
* 150g wholemeal spelt flour
* 150ml warm water[^2]
* 10g fresh yeast (alternatively 7 grams dry yeast)
* ½ teaspoon honey (optional)
* 7g salt
* good splash of olive oil, about 1-2 tablespoons

Sauce:

* 200g peeled and chopped canned tomatoes (alternatively a similar
  preparation from homegrown produce)
* Pinch of salt
* 1 tablespoon of olive oil

Toppings:

* 100g cheese (mozzarella is canonical, but coarsely grated mild young
  Gouda works surprisingly well and you should give it a shot if you
  have it available)
* spicy sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, ham, whatever you fancy

Pan seasoning:

* Splash of olive oil
* Tablespoon of cornstarch
* Pinch of salt
* Ground black pepper
* Oregano


## Equipment

Required:

* One large, thick-bottomed pan with a lid. Can be a cast iron
  skillet, or a non-stick pan, or a thick enamelled frying pan which
  is what I use. What’s important is that the bottom is at least 1cm
  thick, and that the handle can stand being under your oven
  broiler/grill for about 5 minutes.
* Stovetop.
* Oven with broiler/grill.

Optional:

* Stand mixer or kitchen appliance with a dough hook. If
  unavailable, your hands will work just fine.


## Method

1. Prepare a poolish: dissolve the yeast (and honey, if you like) in
   half of the warm water, add flour until the mixture is something
   like porridge. Put in a warm spot[^3] and let rise until the volume has
   doubled (15-30 minutes).

2. Add salt and poolish to the remainder of the flour in a bowl, knead
   and add enough water to make a homogeneous dough. Might take the
   full remaining 150ml, or less, depending on flour. Pour olive oil
   into bowl and and work some in, leaving the sides of the bowl
   nicely greased. Chuck bowl back into warm place and let rise for
   another 15-20 minutes.

3. While dough rises, season the pan. Pour in olive oil, add
   cornstarch, and rub the mixture with your fingers over the whole
   inside of the pan — both the bottom and the walls.  Sprinkle salt,
   pepper, and oregano into the pan.
   
4. Gently spread the dough into a flat round piece roughly the
   diameter of the bottom of the pan. You can use a rolling pin for
   this, but if you do, make sure to grease the rolling pin and
   countertop with olive oil, rather than dusting them with flour like
   you’re perhaps used to.

5. Let the dough rise one more time, about 15 minutes.

6. Prepare the sauce. Simply mix chopped tomatoes with a good pinch of
   salt and some olive oil.

7. Spread the sauce *all across the dough*, covering the whole
   diameter of the pan. Do not leave any uncovered crust on the
   perimeter. Repeat with cheese and finally, toppings.

8. Turn burner on medium heat, put the pan on (cover it with a lid),
   and cook for approximately 8-10 minutes. The trapped steam will
   cook the sauce and toppings on top, while the bottom of the pan
   bakes the crust. Preheat your broiler to high heat.

9. When the cheese on top has started to melt, throw the pan under the
   broiler/grill for about 3 minutes until the cheese gets nice
   patches of golden brown.

10. Turn pizza out on a round pizza plate. It should easily come off
    the bottom of the pan, though the sides might require some
    scraping if cheese has melted and run down the sides. Cut into
    slices.

11. Dig in.

[^1]: In case you’ve never baked with spelt flour before: tastes about
    like wheat, but takes on less water. You can modify this recipe to
    use wheat flour, in which case you’ll need about 375ml of
    water. Also, while a wheat dough normally benefits from a long or
    slow rise, I’ve found that not to be true for spelt.

[^2]: If you’re from the U.S.: yes I know, we Europeans are a bit
    weird in that we customarily give some quantities by weight,
    others by volume. You’d _think_ it’d be straightforward that we do
    solids by weight and liquids by volume, but it isn’t. (Some
    recipes specify sugar by weight, for example, others say use
    so-and-so-many tablespoons of sugar.)

[^3]: My oven has a leavening mode in which I can let a dough rise at
    approximately 39°C and near 100% humidity, which is glorious, but
    this is in no way a requirement. I’ve let dough rise in a bowl
    placed on the floor (we have floor heating), on the running
    laundry dryer, or out on the countertop.
