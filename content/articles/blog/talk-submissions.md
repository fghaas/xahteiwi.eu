Title: Talk submissions

Summary: I put talk submissions on this site, regardless of whether they get accepted or not. Here’s why.

I have spoken at tech conferences for the better part of a decade, and
up to this point I have only ever published [my
talks](/category/presentations.html) after I’ve actually presented
them. I’ll change that from here on out, and I’ll instead record any
talk that I _submit_ to a conference instead, regardless of whether it
ultimately gets accepted or not. I do this for several reasons.

1. **I’d like to have a record of my talk submissions for my own
   reference purposes.**

	It’s rather remarkable how many conference talk submission systems
	exist that make it rather difficult to retrieve your submitted
	abstract a few months or years after the conference. Some event
	websites exist specifically for one instance of a particular
	conference, so they might be taken down a few months after, and
	unaccepted abstracts are usually not accessible publicly — so even
	getting them via the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) is
	not an option. Others record talk submissions via Google Forms,
	into a private Google Sheet, and don’t send an autoreply
	containing the full submission.
	
	So, I use this site for having my own record of talks I submit.

2. **I don’t want to reinforce the illusion that just because I’m an
	experienced speaker, all talks I submit anywhere get accepted.**

	I get talks rejected all the time, _particularly_ from conferences
	I’d _really_ enjoy speaking at. This is normal, and if any of you
	reading this are less experienced and find rejections
	discouraging, I want you to know that they happen to all of us.

3. **I am curious about other people’s thoughts.**

    As a speaker, it is pretty hard to get good feedback on a talk
    submission. Very few conferences send you detailed feedback on
    rejected talks. And none at all, to the best of my knowledge, send
    you qualitative feedback on _accepted_ ones (other than “congrats,
    you’re in!”).
	
	So I figure that if I publish my submissions here, perhaps a few
    people might take a look and chip in some valuable thoughts. And
    even though [this site doesn’t do comments](/comments/), I am
    counting on Twitter and other social networks to spark some.
	
4. **If you run a small conference or meetup that I don’t know about,
	I want to give you the opportunity to reach out to me if there’s a
	topic you’d like to hear me talk about.**
   
    There’s generally far more topics that I’d *like* to do talks on —
    and feel reasonably qualified to — than what I often get selected
    to speak about. In addition, there are _just so many_ conferences
    and meetups out there that it’s impossible to keep track of all of
    them.
	
	So, if you find a topic here that you’d really like at _your_
    event that I absolutely don’t have on my radar, do drop me a line.

5. **If you find any of my talk ideas useful, go ahead and submit your
   own talk like it.**

	Like almost all content on this site, the talk submissions I
	record here are
	[CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en)
	licensed, so as long as you include an acknowledgment, and
	reciprocate by sharing your own talk, please do consider yourself
	encouraged to build your own talk ideas from mine.

**I’ll make one exception from this rule:** some conferences use an
anonymized talk selection process, where submissions must be devoid of
any information that might be remotely likely to identify the
speaker. If I submit a talk to such a conference, I’ll only put the
abstract up here when the selection process is over, the schedule
stands, and I have received a definitive acceptance or rejection
notice. However, in case I am re-submitting a talk previously given at
(or previously submitted to) a different conference, I won’t be
removing *that* article.

You can find my (continuously updated) list of talk submissions
[here](/category/talk-submissions.html), and there’s also an Atom
feed, [here](/feeds/category/talk-submissions.atom.xml).
