Summary: A short series on transitioning to distributed work and asynchronous collaboration. This article is on what you can do if you are stuck in meeting hell as a top-level executive, such as a CEO, Managing Director, or Executive Director.

This part of this series is for you if you are a chief executive
officer, a managing director, executive director, or whatever else the
top-level role in your organization may be. This means that you have
people who report to you, but you don't report to anyone in the
day-to-day operations of the company — even though you may, of course,
be answerable to your board of directors or your investors, or some
oversight body.

So, you realize that

* a lot of your company spends a lot of time in useless meetings,
* they're often forced to sit through 90 minutes of staring into
  cameras when they could instead have spent 5 minutes reading an email,
* people's productivity suffers badly because they are constantly
  being interrupted.

And this is badly affecting you, personally, as well. So for the
benefit of yourself and everyone else in the organization, you want to
change things toward being less interrupt-driven, less synchronous,
more productive, and healthier.

Now, I've got *some* bad news for you.

1. In contrast to your employees at any level, it is much harder for
   you to pull the *Leave* option than it is for them.
2. In contrast to most of your mid-level managers, no matter how hard
   you try, you may *never* escape being in a lot of meetings, and
   being in a lot of *unpleasant* meetings to boot. Chances are, whenever
   stuff is exploding, boiling up, or otherwise going bonkers, you'll
   be roped in to calm things down, make a decision, or soothe a
   high-profile customer who is conniptiously trying to convince you
   that your SLA is akin to the Constitution and that an engineer
   guilty of causing a violation ought to hang for treason.

But, and this is the good news to balance the bad, if you manage to
pull the *rest* of the company out of meeting hell, life is going to
get way better for *you,* too.

So, obviously, there'll be a lot for you to **Learn**. If you've never
led an organization that was distributed and asynchronous by default,
there's a lot to unpack, understand, and overcome when it comes to
turning one that *isn't*, into one that is.

But your most important role at the top of the organization is this:

## Lead.

And by that I mean lead by example, and also lead by policy.

Here are a few ways you can lead by example:

* Write. Particularly when you want to communicate something to the
  whole company. All-hands video streams? *[stage whisper]* Everyone
  hates those. Meeting invites saying "we'll anounce something
  important"? Just write an email *saying the important thing,* and
  then ask people to send you questions by a deadline. And publicly
  commit *yourself* to a deadline by which they can expect answers.

* Take no shortcuts. If you're setting up communications rules for
  everyone, live by them yourself. [There's a bad, hidden cost in
  skirting around them.]({filename}rules-are-rules.md)

* Make a point of always giving context when pinging someone in chat.

* Quit calling people without warning — you can't convey the *context*
  of the call without them answering. A cold call is the ultimate
  [naked ping](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/No_naked_pings).

* Generally, cut back on synchronous, realtime communications. They
  always interrupt people, and [interruptions are
  expensive](https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/). Think
  about how much money you'll lose from someone *not* having a
  brilliant idea because you pinged them about some technicality in
  the company chat while they were deeply immersed in a complex
  problem. (Also, think about how much money you might *have* already
  lost that way.)

* Insist on agendas being drawn up and meeting notes being kept (and
  both *circulated* to anyone who needs the information) for every
  meeting you are asked to attend. Write an agenda for every meeting
  you call or chair. If you have a group that meets regularly, appoint a
  different person from the group as a scribe each time. Do not ask a
  person to volunteer. (If you do, chances are that one person in the
  group will be typecast as the scribe for all such meetings. I call
  such an unfortunate person a *scrapegoat.* You don't want
  scrapegoats.)

Then, here are ways you can lead by policy:

* Hire professional writers. (In the software industry, tech writers
  come to mind.) Not because you want *those* people to be
  scrapegoats, but because professional writers can massively move
  your organization forward in efficiency of written expression,
  document organization, and clarity of communications. Make them a
  hiring priority. Pay them handsomely — good tech writers can make
  good money freelancing; you'll need to make them a pretty compelling
  offer to consider giving up some of that freedom.
  
* Ram a stake in the ground making clear to everyone you will not
  tolerate corporate surveillance or invasions of privacy. Any attempt
  to introduce an "always on camera" policy should be grounds for
  reprimanding the manager that instigated it.

* Insist on the procurement of tools that take distributed,
  asynchronous work into account. A video conferencing system that
  values surveillance over privacy is not one your company should
  throw money at. A hiring platform that requires specifying an
  "office location" for every role, and has no provisions for remote
  positions, isn't either. Neither is a chat platform hosted by a
  company whose sole chance at long-term success is to pull *all*
  corporate communications into synchronous chat. Yes, these judgments
  require technical expertise. If this is something you don't have
  because you consider yourself a "non-technical" person, [I have
  something to read for you]({filename}non-technical.md).

There's another thing that you *might* be inclined toward doing:
declaring meeting-free days, as in making it a policy that no meetings
are to be scheduled on Wednesdays. I think of that as very much a
stop-gap measure that's often done out of sheer despair. Sure, you
want your people to have meeting-free days, but you actually want them
to have *meeting days,* with meetingless days being the norm, rather
than the exception. I think you're better off gradually replacing your
meeting-addicted managers with ones that are accustomed to distributed
and asynchronous work.

Finally, and this may be a bitter pill to swallow: getting to
distributed and asynchronous is infinitely harder if you have built a
"flat" organization. If every one of your managers has 20-30 direct
reports, they will feel utterly overwhelmed at the thought of staying
in asynchronous communication with every one of them, not to mention
the fact that it's damn near impossible for them to convince that many
people at one time to adopt a new way of collaboration.

This is one of the many, many ways in which [flat organizations fail
to
scale](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/flat-organizational-structure-fails/),
but this gives you the opportunity to fix two issues at the same
time. If you've got one manager that's actively promoting meeting hell
that is currently making life miserable for 20 people, you can split
that team up into 4, and hire 3 team leads that know how to work
asynchronously and distributed (or promote people who have that sort
of experience and want to step up). Then, in the one remaining team
with the unreformed meeting addict, things can go three ways:

* The one "traditional" team sees how things go in the other teams,
  and they quickly coax their team lead into doing things the new way, or
* they all ask to be transferred, or
* (the worst-case scenario) the one meeting-addicted manager continues
  to annoy everyone, and they all leave. That's bad, and a failure of
  judgment (that manager should probably have been let go first), but
  losing 4 good people, as difficult as that might be, is probably
  “better” than losing 20.

As a final thought, *please* take a moment to put yourself in other
people's shoes, and understand what options *they* have with being
stuck in meeting hell. Whether it's your [line
managers]({filename}getting-out-of-meeting-hell-managers.md) or your
regular
[employees]({filename}getting-out-of-meeting-hell-employees.md), they
both have the option to just chuck in their notice and leave, and
leave they will, if they're sufficiently deep in meeting hell. They
have plenty of opportunities.

So lead by example, and lead by policy. Do things right, but more
importantly do the right things.
