Title: About me (and this site)
Slug: about

I’ve worked pretty much exclusively with open source software since
about the time I graduated from college in 2003. I worked at a small
outfit out of Vienna called ADS-System, which was then
[acquired](https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20050404_OTS0022/kapsch-businesscom-kauft-ads-system-ausbau-des-geschaeftsbereichs-it-und-netzwerkloesungen)
by [Kapsch BusinessCom](https://www.kapsch.net/kbc). I then went to
work for [LINBIT](https://www.linbit.com) for about 4½ years, and
co-founded hastexo with my partners Martin Loschwitz and Andreas Kurz
in 2011. We parted ways 3 years in, and 3 years after _that_ I [sold
hastexo](https://www.citynetwork.eu/pressreleases/city-network-shifts-high-gear-hastexo-acquisition/)
to [City Network AB](https://www.citynetwork.eu).

At City Network I currently serve as Head of Education, and I am also
the MD of City Network Education Services, the legal entity formerly
known as hastexo (the hastexo brand is defunct). Some of the content
on this site was originally hosted on `hastexo.com`, was not carried
over onto the City Cloud web site, and I’ve resurrected it here based
on popular demand and for reference purposes. Such content is clearly
spelled out as such at the bottom of the respective pages. Regardless,
**I work on this site in my spare time** (which is also why articles
tend to appear here on weekends) **and you should not mistake
anything on this site as official pronouncements of my employer.** For
those, please head over to [citycloud.com](https://www.citycloud.com).

Most of the articles on this site cover technical issues, largely
around [OpenStack](/tag/openstack.html), [Open
edX](/tag/open-edx.html), and [Ceph](/tag/ceph.html) — but there’s
also a sprinkling of [Python](/tag/python.html) content and other
topics. Some are write-ups of [conference](/tag/conference.html)
talks. Some articles are about how people [work](/tag/work.html). Some are
labeled _[Philosophy](/tag/philosophy.html),_ though _Ramblings_ might
be a more appropriate tag.
