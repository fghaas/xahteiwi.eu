Title: About comments on this site
Slug: comments

Pretty simple: there aren’t any. <!--break--> If you find something
interesting and want to discuss it, then share it on your favorite
social network, and your friends will see what you think.

Unless you have exceptionally boring and stubborn friends, this will
stimulate the discussion far better than a random comment on a random
blog will.

And if you want to get in touch with **me** to discuss, peek over to
your right (or below, if you’re reading this on a mobile device), and
find me on one of the social networks you see there.
